In two words: concat two strings(/arrays)
The Assembly program finds the first character that equal to 0 in the array the EDI points to, this is by convention end of string (- array of characters) ('/0' character = 0 in ASCII).
then, the program copy the array that ESI points to until the end, in the place where EDI ends.
note: I used the words "character","array","string" to describe the data but of course it is just bytes and we can interpret it in many ways.
